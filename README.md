**OVERVIEW**

This assignment was given by Kadatemy to test each student's level of understanding the data analytics and visualisation classes that we have been taught so far.

It was also to assess our curiosity and research skills regarding how we solve problems beyond what was taught in the classroom.

The dataset used herein was gotten from the [Github link](https://github.com/sharonibejih/Analysis-on-Nigerians-Demography) of our tutor - Sharon Ibejih, and my solutions are presented forward.

The presentation tone I used in this task is semi-formal.

Equally, for interpretation purposes, the currency for the monetary values in this document is Nigerian Naira (NGN).
